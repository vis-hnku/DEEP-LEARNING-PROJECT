DEEP LEARNING PROJECT

NAME: P.Vishnu Prakash

INTERN ID: CT04DH1031

DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION: 4 WEEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH





1. Define the Problem – Classification, regression, etc.
2. Collect Data – From sources like APIs, sensors, or datasets.
3. Preprocess Data – Clean, normalize, encode, split into train/val/test.
4. Explore Data – Understand patterns and imbalances (EDA).
5. Choose Model – Pick suitable architecture (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.).
6. Build Model– Define layers, activations, loss, optimizer.
7. Train Model– Fit model on training data, validate performance.
8. Evaluate Model – Use test data to measure accuracy, F1, etc.
9. Tune Hyperparameters – Optimize learning rate, batch size, etc.
10.Deploy Model** – Export and integrate with apps or APIs.
11. Monitor & Update – Track performance, retrain with new data.
